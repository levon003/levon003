Hi there! I'm a data scientist and researcher.

You can learn more about my research interests [on my homepage](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~levon003/).

Here are a few of my research prototypes:

 - [HealthBlogRec](https://github.com/levon003/HealthBlogRec): a prototype deep learning recommender system for health blogs.
 - [ALSim](https://github.com/levon003/ALSim): a simulation library that implements several state-of-the-art active learning algorithms.
 - [wiki-ores-feedback](https://github.com/levon003/wiki-ores-feedback): a web app and auditing analysis for vandalism detection classifiers on Wikipedia.
